# Developer skills (that any developer needs to know)
Here we talk about the skills that are expected from any developer (by rank) at Code &amp; Coffee 55. This is not a tech list, it is indeed a mindset for all our projects. 


When starting to code, we usually want to right a lot of code. But, actually, we do not need to write a lot of code to be a good developer. At Code & Coffee 55, the ``simplicity`` is the most important concept. ``Do not write code that is not needed``. 

## 1 Code in a ``clean``, ``structured``, ``modularized``, ``solid``, following the ``good practices`` for each language with the ``good style`` imposed for each programming language or Code & Coffee 55 itself. 

## 2 Write ``unit tests`` for each basic function in the code.

## 3 Get to know different ways to work with ``git``. ``Gitflow Workflow`` is the most used at Code & Coffee 55. But, some projects can use some ``Trunk Based Development`` or ``other strategies``. In the end, the most important is to ``have a good documentation posture`` for the commit log.

## 4 Get to know the DevOps basics. That is to say, implement a ``Continuous Integration (CI)`` approach for every project that you work on with a ``Continuous Delivery (CD)`` strategy for deployment.

## 5 ``Be open to critics and feedback``. ``Code reviews`` are the best way that we can improve the code base at Code & Coffee 55. But, the open-minded posture does not end in the code. Any developer needs to be open for ``communication`` with others in order to improve ``teamwork``.

## 6 Have a ``good posture`` when ``working in a team`` (Dividing in a good way the personal life from the team work, in the end, it is all about ``mutual help``)

## 7 ``Love programming`` (and here I mean really love coding and ``developing new solutions``). As many languages as possible, with ``different procedures`` and ``code styles``, ``design patterns``, many ways to do the same thing and ``different tools``.

## 8 We already said in 1, but due to its importance: practice every single day the ``Clean Code`` mindset for any piece of code that you bring to life. 

## 9 ``Know`` and ``contribute`` to the ``open source community``.

## 10 Be ``open-minded`` for any kind of feedback, that being in a ``code review or not``.

## 11 Work in ``different kinds of projects`` with ``different technologies`` and ``architectures``. Staying in the same architecture for a long time do not help us to improve our coding skills.

# The ``gap`` between a ``junior dev`` and a ``mid-level dev``
After coding for some time in a company or in any association, we start to learn new ways (``better ways``) to do what we intend to do. This is exactly the gap between a junior dev and a mid-level dev. Is is the technologies that a mid-level dev knows that a junior dev does not. 

When you start to feel pretty confident with the technologies used in industry and you start to really see results, you can call yourself a mid-level dev. 

# The ``gap`` between a ``mid-level dev`` and a ``senior dev``
A senior dev ``is not`` a senior dev because he or she know a lot of technologies, frameworks or programming languages. 

A senior dev is a developer that knows how to deal with code in a more realistic way to take value from it. A senior dev knows what is important to code and what is not. The ``gap`` is indeed a difference in ``posture``, where we can start to see a ``developer that acts as a professional`` and we feel that he or she is worth of our trust and can take a lot of ``responsability`` and show ``good results``.
